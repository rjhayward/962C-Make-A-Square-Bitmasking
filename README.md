# 962C Make A Square(Bitmasking)
This is a Java 8 program designed according to the specification of the CodeForces Algorithm Challenge: http://codeforces.com/contest/962/problem/C

This program uses bitmasking to loop through all possible setups of the input string and finds the largest number contained within the string which satisfies these prerequisites:
    - The square root of this number must be an integer
    - The number must not have any leading zeroes
